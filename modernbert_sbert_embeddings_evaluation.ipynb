    "This notebook evaluates a dual embedding model that combines ModernBERT and Sentence-BERT (SBERT) for the task of evidence detection. The model uses a combination of contextualized embeddings from ModernBERT and sentence embeddings from SBERT to predict whether a piece of evidence supports a given claim."
